# FuelGraph-FBP
This is the original Excel version of FuelGraph, the fire behaviour visualization tool for the Fire Behaviour Prediction System

I was trying to avoid maintaining this in Excel (slowly working on building an R version), but there still appears to be interest, so I'll keep it current for now.  
Version 5.1 is current, which is bilingual (change cell A32 to switch from Fr to Eng).
